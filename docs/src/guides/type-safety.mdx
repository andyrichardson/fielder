# Type safety

_Fielder is written in TypeScript and supports type safety out of the box_.

## Why to use types

By using types with Fielder, you can:

- Enforce field types (setters and return values)
- Enforce field names (prevent typos)

## Basic typing

In order to begin, you'll need to create an interface/type which demonstrates all the fields which could be mounted in your form.

```ts
interface MyFormState {
  username: string;
  password: string;
  saveCredentials: boolean;
}
```

Now, when calling `useField`, `useForm`, or `useFormContext`, pass your form state as a generic.

```tsx
const [fieldProps] = useField<MyFormState>({ name: 'password' });
```

## Advanced typing

If you prefer not to manually type every hook call, you can re-export them.

> You'll want to follow this process for each form you create.

Create a `fielder.ts` file alongside your form's root component and copy the example below.

```ts
import { typedHooks } from 'fielder';
import { FormType } from './types';

export const { useField, useForm, useFormContext } = typedHooks<FormType>();
```

Now when using any of the _Fielder_ hooks, import them from the file you just created.

```tsx
import { useField } from '../fielder';

// ...
const [fieldProps] = useField({
  name: 'invalidName', // Type error!
});
```
