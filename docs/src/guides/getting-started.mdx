# Getting started

All you need to know to start using `Fielder`.

## Creating a form

So you know you want to make a form but don't know where to start? Look no further!

### Install fielder

Add fielder to your dependencies using you package manager of choice.

```sh
npm i fielder
```

### Create your form component

Every form starts in the same way, you want to make your form component which is going to:

- Create an instance of `Fielder`
- Expose that instance to any children

```tsx
import React, { useEffect } from "react"
import { useForm, FielderProvider } from "fielder"

const LoginForm = ({ children }) => {
  const formState = useForm()

  // Example of reacting to form changes
  useEffect(() => {
    console.log("Form state has changed!", formState)
  }, [formState])

  return <FielderProvider value={formState}>{children}</FielderProvider>
}
```

The use of `FielderProvider` ensures that `useField` can later access the form state.

> Forms can be a small section on a page, or can span across multiple pages (i.e. steppers/wizards/multi-step).

## Adding some fields

Next we want to add some fields to our form.

> It's important to remember that fielder treats fields as dynamic entities. This means they can be added, removed, and/or changed at any time.

```tsx
const MyFormContent = () => {
  const [usernameProps] = useField({
    name: "username",
  })
  const [passwordProps] = useField({
    name: "password",
  })

  return (
    <form>
      <input type="text" {...usernameProps} />
      <input type="text" {...passwordProps} />
    </form>
  )
}
```
