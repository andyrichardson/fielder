# Getting started

All you need to know to start using `Fielder`.

## Creating a form

So you know you want to make a form but don't know where to start? Look no further!

### Install fielder

Add fielder to your dependencies using you package manager of choice.

```sh
npm i fielder
```

### Create your form component

Every form starts in the same way, you want to make your form component which is going to:

- Create an instance of `Fielder`
- Expose that instance to any children

```tsx
import React, { useEffect } from 'react';
import { useForm, FielderProvider } from 'fielder';

const LoginForm = ({ children }) => {
  const formState = useForm();

  // Example of reacting to form changes
  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('Form state has changed!', formState);
  }, [formState]);

  return <FielderProvider value={formState}>{children}</FielderProvider>;
};
```

The use of `FielderProvider` ensures that `useField` can later access the form state.

> Forms can be a small section on a page, or can span across multiple pages (i.e. steppers/wizards/multi-step).

## Adding some fields

Next we want to add some fields to our form.

> It's important to remember that fielder treats fields as dynamic entities. This means they can be added, removed, and/or changed at any time.

```tsx
const MyFormContent = () => {
  const [usernameProps] = useField({
    name: 'username'
  });
  const [passwordProps] = useField({
    name: 'password'
  });

  return (
    <form>
      <input type="text" {...usernameProps} />
      <input type="text" {...passwordProps} />
    </form>
  );
};
```

## Checkbox and Radio inputs

Checkbox and radio inputs are different to all other field types as their state is declared by the `checked`
attribute rather than `value` ([more info here](https://github.com/andyrichardson/fielder/issues/23#issuecomment-576352847)).

To prevent hacking around with refs, you'll need to manually set the value and checked attributes.

```tsx
const [hobbiesProps] = useField({
  name: 'hobbies',
  initialValue: ['sports'],
});
const [termsProps] = useField({
  name: 'terms'
});

const hobbiesOptions = useMemo(() => [
  { label: "Sports", value: "sports" },
  { label: "Coding", value: "coding" },
  { label: "Other", value: "other" },
], []);

const termsOptions = useMemo(() => [
  { label: "Yes", value: "yes" },
  { label: "No", value: "no" },
], [])

return (
  <>
    <fieldset>
      <p>What are your hobbies</p>
      {hobbiesOptions.map(({ label, value }) => (
        <input
          key={value}
          type="checkbox"
          {...hobbiesProps}
          value={value}
          checked={hobbiesProps.value.includes(value)}
        />
        {label}
      ))}
    </fieldset>
    <fieldset>
      <p>Do you accept the terms & conditions</p>
      {termsOptions.map(({ label, value }) => (
        <input
          key={value}
          type="radio"
          {...termsProps}
          value={value}
          checked={termsProps.value === value}
        />
        {label}
      ))}
    </fieldset>
  </>
);
```

### Things to note

The value attribute should be specified after spreading in your field props

```tsx
// This will not work
<input type="radio" value="accept" {...radioProps} />

// This will work
<input type="radio" {...radioProps} value="accept" />
```

Set the initial value of your checkbox state to an array

```tsx
const [hobbiesProps] = useField({
  name: 'hobbies',
  initialValue: ['sports', 'coding'] // checkboxes with these values will be checked
});
```
