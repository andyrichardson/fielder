# Getting started

All you need to know to start using `Fielder`.

## Creating a form

So you know you want to make a form but don't know where to start? Look no further!

### Install fielder

Add fielder to your dependencies using you package manager of choice.

```sh
npm i fielder
```

### Create your form component

Every form starts in the same way, you want to make your form component which is going to:

- Create an instance of `Fielder`
- Expose that instance to any children

```tsx
import React, { useEffect } from 'react';
import { useForm, FielderProvider } from 'fielder';

const LoginForm = ({ children }) => {
  const formState = useForm();

  // Example of reacting to form changes
  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('Form state has changed!', formState);
  }, [formState]);

  return <FielderProvider value={formState}>{children}</FielderProvider>;
};
```

The use of `FielderProvider` ensures that `useField` can later access the form state.

> Forms can be a small section on a page, or can span across multiple pages (i.e. steppers/wizards/multi-step).

## Adding some fields

Next we want to add some fields to our form.

> It's important to remember that fielder treats fields as dynamic entities. This means they can be added, removed, and/or changed at any time.

```tsx
const MyFormContent = () => {
  const [usernameProps] = useField({
    name: 'username'
  });
  const [passwordProps] = useField({
    name: 'password'
  });

  return (
    <form>
      <input type="text" {...usernameProps} />
      <input type="text" {...passwordProps} />
    </form>
  );
};
```

## Checkbox and Radio inputs

Checkbox and radio inputs are different to all other field types as their state is declared by the `checked`
attribute rather than `value` ([more info here](https://github.com/andyrichardson/fielder/issues/23#issuecomment-576352847)).

```tsx
const [hobbiesProps] = useField({
  name: 'hobbies'
});
const [termsProps] = useField({
  name: 'terms'
});

return (
  <>
    <fieldset>
      <p>What are your hobbies</p>
      <input type="checkbox" {...hobbiesProps} value="sports" /> Sports
      <input type="checkbox" {...hobbiesProps} value="coding" /> Coding
      <input type="checkbox" {...hobbiesProps} value="other" /> Other
    </fieldset>
    <fieldset>
      <p>Do you accept the terms & conditions</p>
      <input type="radio" {...termsProps} value="yes" /> Yes
      <input type="radio" {...termsProps} value="no" /> No
    </fieldset>
  </>
);
```

### Things to note

Use the `input` element, or a component which forwards the `ref` prop

```tsx
// This will prevent the checked state from being in sync
<input type="radio" {...radioProps} value="accept" ref={someOtherRef} />
```

> Because of how checkboxes differ to other elements, `ref` access to checkbox and radio elements is required

**Do not** manually set the checked prop - this is handled by Fielder.

```tsx
// This is unnecessary and will cause conflicts
<input type="radio" {...radioProps} value="accept" checked={someCondition} />
```
