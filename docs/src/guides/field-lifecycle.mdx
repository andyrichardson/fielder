# Field lifecycle

Fields have a few key events you'll want to know about. Understanding the
lifecylce of a field will help with choosing _when to apply validation_ and also
with debugging.

## 1. Mount

The field is mounted for the first time and is initialized in the form state.

> Note: This can cause a number of changes to the form-wide state such as the _valid_ and _validating_ states.

## 2. Change

The field has changed in some way and the form state is updated.

Change events include:

- value is changed _(onChange)_
- field is blurred _(onBlur)_
- field validation has changed _(new "validate" option passed to useField)_

## 3. Unmount

The field is no longer mounted and is set as inactive in the form-wide state.

Optionally, the field can be be purged from the form state.

> Note: Inactive fields are not validated, however, other fields can still see their values and validate accordingly.

## 4. Remount (optional)

Fields which have not been purged can be re-mounted. In this case, their
value prior to unmounting will be used.

Remounting is the default functionality of a field and is often useful
when working with multi-page forms.
