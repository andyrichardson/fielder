# Validation

Validation is one of the key ways in which Fielder differentiates itself from other libraries.

## How validation works

While most libraries require a form's validation criteria to be declared upfront, Fielder
treats validation as an **evolutionary** process.

> Fielder allows you to have a valid state, even if your whole form isn't ready to be submitted

This has the following advantages:

- Validation can be incrementally added
- Presenting validation state to the user is much simpler
- Wizards/steppers/multi-page forms just work (see below)

### Valid states

A form is valid when all **visible** fields are valid.

A valid state implies the user has done their job and is able to progress to the next action (i.e. next page, next section, submit).

### Using validation

Adding validation is as simple as providing a function to `useField` which is called on a given change event.

> Form-wide validation is not supported in Fielder (see above for reasons why).

## Basic validation

```tsx
useField({
  name: 'password'
  validate: validatePassword,
});

// ...
const validatePassword = (val) => {
  if (!val || val.length < 8) {
    throw Error("Password must be 8 characters long");
  }
};
```

Your validation function should take 1 or 2 values (field state and form state, respectively), and should
throw an error orn string if validation is not successful.

## Cross field validation

The below example demonstrates is a cross field validation function which checks other values within the form.

```tsx
const validateDrink = (val, state) => {
  if (Number(state.age.value) < 21 && val === 'Beer') {
    throw Error('You must be 21 to order Beer');
  }
};
```

## Conditional validation

As you would expect, Fielder reacts to changes to it's hooks. This means validation functions
can be conditionally added, changed and/or removed at any time.

```tsx
useField({
  name: 'password'
  validate: useMemo(() =>
    shouldValidate ? validatePassword : undefined,
    [shouldValidate]
  ),
});
```

> You'll want to wrap any functions being declared inside of a component with `useCallback`

## Using 3rd party libraries

You can use simple JS, or any validation library you desire (including `Yup`).

```tsx
const validateFn = val => Yup.string().validateSync(val);
```

> It's advised that you use synchronous validation where possible to reduce the number of
> renders in your form.

## Presenting validation

Field level validation messages can be presented to the user conditionally using the [field metadata](/api/usefield/#usefieldmeta).

```jsx
const [passwordProps, passwordMeta] = useField({
  name: 'password'
  validate: validatePassword,
});

return (
  <>
    <input type="password" {...passwordProps} />
    {passwordMeta.touched && passwordMeta.error && <ErrorMessage>{passwordMeta.error}</ErrorMessage>}
  </>
)
```

You can also use the form-wide validation state to prevent users from proceeding.

```jsx
const { isValid } = useFormContext();

//...

return (
  <button disabled={!isValid} onClick={handleSubmit}>
    Submit
  </button>
);
```
